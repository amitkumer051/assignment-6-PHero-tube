                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Answer:</p>
                    <p>Var: The scope of a var variable is functional scope.It can be updated and re-declared into the
                        scope.It can be declared without initialization.It can be accessed without initialization as its
                        default value is undefined.hoisting done, with initializing as default value.</p>
                    <p>Let: The scope of a let variable is block scope.It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into
                        the
                        scope.It can be declared without initialization.It cannot be accessed without initialization
                        otherwise it will give referenceError.</p>

                    <p>Const: The scope of a const variable is block scope.It cannot be updated or re-declared into the
                        scope.It cannot be declared without initialization.It cannot be accessed without initialization,
                        as
                        it cannot be declared without initialization.Hoisting is done, but not initialized (this is the
                        reason for the error when we access the const variable before declaration/initialization</p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="question">Q2: Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Answer:</p>
                    <p>Null: It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of
                        JavaScript.It
                        is often assigned to variables, properties, or elements to indicate that they intentionally have
                        no
                        value or that they should be considered empty.Null is an intentional value set by the programmer
                        to
                        signify emptiness.
                    <div>
                        Example: let myVariable = null;
                        const person = {
                        name: 'John',
                        age: null,
                        };
                        Output:Null;
                    </div>
                    </p>

                    <p>Undefined: It means the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.t is
                        typically
                        used when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value.It can also be used as
                        an
                        indicator for missing properties in objects or missing elements in arrays.
                    <div>
                        Example: const person = {};
                        console.log(person.age);
                        Output:Undefined.
                    </div>
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Q3: What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
                    <p>Answer:</p>
                    <p>An API, or application programming interface,is a set of rules that define how
                        applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API
                        that
                        conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural
                        style.REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It
                        is a set
                        of architectural principles and constraints for designing networked applications.REST is not a
                        specific
                        technology but rather a style of designing networked applications that use the HTTP protocol for
                        communication.RESTful APIs are widely used for building web services and are known for their
                        simplicity
                        and scalability.</p>
